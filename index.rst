0. Introduction
===============

This document shall show, in a 27-step process, how to install Grommunio
components manually. It is targeted at adept administrators. Pictured above and
subsequently is the typical boot phase of many a contemporary Linux systems.

Pictures in this document depict a (what is initially) a fairly minimalist
openSUSE Tumbleweed container as a base. However, the choice of system used for
the screenshots shall be of no concern. The reader ought to be familiar with
any peculiarities that their particular environment has bestowed upon them, be
it in boot, in package management or configuration of services.

. . . Too complicated? Then use the grommunio Appliance.


1. Establish networking
=======================

.. image:: network1.png

For this particular container, I had enabled ``systemd-networkd`` and put the
network configuration in place apriori. If anything, this section is but a
reminder to hook up the host to Internet, as it will be needed to get at
package repositories later. The particular method of network configuration
varies wildly between operating systems, and not every system is using
systemd-networkd. Consult the documentation relevant for your environment to
get online.

.. image:: network2.png

IPv6 is mandatory on the host itself. If you have ``::1`` assigned, all is
good.

You are well advised to install and configure a packet filter, a.k.a. a
firewall, with the sensible default of disallowing every service by default,
save perhaps for a way to let yourself in. More details will be presented
throughout the sections going forward.


2. Declare hostname identity
============================

.. image:: hostname1.png

If you have not consciously set a hostname yet, do so now, especially if some
default setting has left you with localhost as the hostname. You cannot
reasonably reach localhost from another machine without unnecessary pains.

I decided to use ``route27.test`` for the domain part of later e-mail addresses
(e.g. ``someuser@route27.test``), and this particular machine that Grommunio
will be installed on has received a hostname of ``mail.route27.test``.
Arbitrary names can be chosen so long as they make sense for their intended
network.


3. Package manager setup
========================

Visit `<https://download.grommunio.com>`_ to get an idea of the list of platforms for
which pre-built packages have been made available. Even though different
operating systems may use the same archive format (RPM, DEB, etc.) or
repository metadata formats (rpm-md, apt), do not use a repository which does
not exactly match your system. Do not use Debian packages for an Ubuntu system
or vice-versa. Do not use openSUSE packages for a Fedora system or vice-versa.
Do not even remotely think of converting between formats. 

zypp
----

openSUSE uses yum-style ``.repo`` files for declaring repositories. Based on
the Tumbleweed container introduced earlier, one can create a file
``/etc/zypp/repos.d/grommunio.repo`` and populate it like so:

.. image:: repo-1.png

.. code-block::

	[grommunio]
	enabled=1
	autorefresh=1
	baseurl=https://download.grommunio.com/community/openSUSE_Tumbleweed
	type=rpm-md
	keeppackages=0

Retrieve the GPG key and import it into the RPM database to trust it. Then,
optionally, download the repository metadata (if not, it will be done the next
time you install anything).

.. image:: repo-2.png

.. image:: repo-3.png

dnf
---

RHEL uses ``.repo`` files as well, though in another directory. The file to edit
would be ``/etc/yum.repos.d/grommunio.repo``, with contents:

.. code-block::

	[grommunio]
	enabled=1
	autorefresh=1
	baseurl=https://download.grommunio.com/community/EL_8
	type=rpm-md
	keeppackages=0

Import the GPG key likewise, then proceed to use dnf or yum commands to update
at your leisure.

apt
---

For Debian, one is to add into ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/grommunio.list``:

.. code-block::

	deb [trusted=yes] https://download.grommunio.com/community/Debian_11 Debian_11 main

Then import the GPG key and proceed to use apt commands to update at your
leisure.

4. nginx
========

nginx is used as a frontend to handle all HTTP requests, and to forward them to
further individual services. For example, RPC/HTTP requests will be delegated
to Gromox for further processing, Administration API (AAPI for short) requests
will be delegated to an uwsgi instance for further processing, and {{something
about g-chat}}.

An alternative HTTP server may be used if you feel comfortable in configuring
all of it, however this guide will only focus on nginx. Now then, source the
nginx package from your operating system, and have the service started both on
next boot and immediately.

.. image:: nginx-1.png

.. image:: nginx-2.png

In this screenshot, we also requested the installation of the nginx VTS module,
which is optionally used by AAPI for reporting traffic statistics. VTS is
**not** available for all platforms, in which case you have to omit make do
without it.

Being the main entrypoint for everything, the nginx HTTPS network service,
generally port 443, will need to be configured in the packet filter to be
accessible.


5. MariaDB
==========

MariaDB/MySQL is used to store the user database amongst a few auxiliary
configuration parameters. If you plan on erecting a multi-host Gromox cluster,
this database is the one that is meant to be globally available to all nodes
that will eventually be running Gromox services.

A preexisting MariaDB/MySQL server may be used. All the standard tools and
procedures that the world community has developed around SQL are applicable, in
terms of e.g. configuration, backup/restore, and replication.

Assuming though that you are going for a new SQL server instance, source the
MariaDB/MySQL packages from your operating system, and have the service started
both on next boot and immediately.

.. image:: mysql-1.png

.. image:: mysql-2.png

After the installation, do create a blank database and user identity for
accessing it.

.. image:: mysql-3.png

.. code-block:: sql

	CREATE DATABASE `grommunio`;
	GRANT ALL ON `grommunio`.* TO 'grommunio'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'freddledgruntbuggly';

The MariaDB network service is not meant to be open to the public Internet.
Within your private network, it may need to be opened if (and only if) you plan
on using it in a multi-host Grommunio setup, or when your plans about database
replication demand it.


6. Gromox
=========

Gromox is the central groupware server component of grommunio. It provides
the services for Outlook RPC, IMAP/POP3, an LDA for ingestion, and a PHP
module for Z-MAPI.

The package is available by way of the Grommunio repositories. This guide is
subsequently based on such a pre-built Gromox. Experts wishing to build from
source and who have general knowledge on how to do so are referred to the
[https://github.com/grommunio/gromox/doc/install.rst](Gromox installation
documentation) on specific aspects of the build procedure.

.. image:: gromox-1.png

The connection parameters for MariaDB need to be conveyed to Gromox with the
file ``/etc/gromox/mysql_adaptor.cfg``, whose contents could look like this::

	mysql_username=grommunio
	mysql_password=freddledgruntbuggly
	mysql_dbname=grommunio
	schema_upgrade=host:mail.route27.test

The final line about ``schema_upgrade=``, while not a connection parameter in
its own right, declares that this very host will be the authoritative entity
that is allowed to perform database schema upgrades. Having this line is
desirable, because the Gromox default setting is not to perform any schema
upgrades — this is in consideration of possible multi-host Gromox setups.

With Gromox instrumented on the SQL parameters, proceed now with performing the
initial creation of the database tables by issuing the command:

.. code-block::

	gromox-dbop -C

.. image:: gromox-2.png

Gromox runs a number of processes and network services. None of them are meant
to be open to the public Internet, because nginx is already that important
point of ingress. The Gromox exmdb service (port 5000/tcp by default) needs to
be reachable from other Gromox nodes in a multi-host grommunio setup for
reasons of internal forwarding to a mailbox's home server.


7. Administration interface
===========================

Install ``grommunio-admin-api``

.. code-block::

	zypper in grommunio-admin-api grommunio-admin-web

Fragments are placed in /usr/share/grommunio-common/...
In the nginx configuration, include this fragment ...


8. Create first user
====================

...


9. Outlook connection
=====================

...


10. grommunio-web frontend
==========================

.. code-block::

	zypper in grommunio-web

(hook up to nginx / gromox pool / ...)
