0. Introduction
===============

This document shall show, in a 27-step process, how to install Grommunio
components manually. It is targeted at adept administrators. Pictured above and
subsequently is the typical boot phase of many a contemporary Linux systems.

Pictures in this document depict a (what is initially) a fairly minimalist
openSUSE Tumbleweed container as a base. However, the choice of system used for
the screenshots shall be of no concern. The reader ought to be familiar with
any peculiarities that their particular environment has bestowed upon them, be
it in boot, in package management or configuration of services.

. . . Too complicated? Then use the grommunio Appliance.


0.1. Scale out considerations
=============================

To deploy grommunio over multiple hosts/containers/etc., each host needs to be
populated with a base operating system and the grommunio packages (all, or a
subset).

In case of deployment to a dedicated host (bare metal or virtual machine), the
base OS and packages can be provided by the ISO/OVA appliance images. The
filesystem tree from the RAW image can be used for container environments
(boot-from-directory). Equally though, you can install a base OS of choice
yourself and fill it with the grommunio packages.

YOU decide how you want to split the required resources (CPUs, RAM, disk)
across hosts. You can put all mailboxes and all services on a single monster
machine, or you can create one container for every individual mailbox and every
individual user-facing service. Both extremes are possible, though not
necessarily cost-effective. One big iron machine may cost more to procure than
two irons of half the size. Likewise, running two mailboxes rather than one per
container is more effective because the operating system and processes need not
be replicated that often. However you split it is a determination YOU must
make.

1. Establish networking
=======================

.. image:: network1.png

For this particular container, I had enabled ``systemd-networkd`` and put the
network configuration in place apriori. If anything, this section is but a
reminder to hook up the host to Internet, as it will be needed to get at
package repositories later. The particular method of network configuration
varies wildly between operating systems, and not every system is using
systemd-networkd. Consult the documentation relevant for your environment to
get online.

.. image:: network2.png

IPv6 is mandatory on the host itself. If you have ``::1`` assigned, all is
good.

You are well advised to install and configure a packet filter, a.k.a. a
firewall, with the sensible default of disallowing every service by default,
save perhaps for a way to let yourself in. More details will be presented
throughout the sections going forward.


2. Declare hostname identity
============================

.. image:: hostname1.png

If you have not consciously set a hostname yet, do so now, especially if some
default setting has left you with localhost as the hostname. You cannot
reasonably reach localhost from another machine without unnecessary pains.

I decided to use ``route27.test`` for the domain part of later e-mail addresses
(e.g. ``someuser@route27.test``), and this particular machine that Grommunio
will be installed on has received a hostname of ``mail.route27.test``.
Arbitrary names can be chosen so long as they make sense for their intended
network.


3. Package manager setup
========================

Visit `<https://download.grommunio.com>`_ to get an idea of the list of platforms for
which pre-built packages have been made available. Even though different
operating systems may use the same archive format (RPM, DEB, etc.) or
repository metadata formats (rpm-md, apt), do not use a repository which does
not exactly match your system. Do not use Debian packages for an Ubuntu system
or vice-versa. Do not use openSUSE packages for a Fedora system or vice-versa.
Do not even remotely think of converting between formats. 

zypp
----

openSUSE uses yum-style ``.repo`` files for declaring repositories. Based on
the Tumbleweed container introduced earlier, one can create a file
``/etc/zypp/repos.d/grommunio.repo`` and populate it like so:

.. image:: repo-1.png

.. code-block::

	[grommunio]
	enabled=1
	autorefresh=1
	baseurl=https://download.grommunio.com/community/openSUSE_Tumbleweed
	type=rpm-md
	keeppackages=0

Retrieve the GPG key and import it into the RPM database to trust it. Then,
optionally, download the repository metadata (if not, it will be done the next
time you install anything).

.. image:: repo-2.png

.. image:: repo-3.png

.. code-block::

	curl https://download.grommunio.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-grommunio >gr.key
	rpm --import gr.key

dnf
---

RHEL uses ``.repo`` files as well, though in another directory. The file to edit
would be ``/etc/yum.repos.d/grommunio.repo``, with contents:

.. code-block::

	[grommunio]
	enabled=1
	autorefresh=1
	baseurl=https://download.grommunio.com/community/EL_8
	type=rpm-md
	keeppackages=0

Import the GPG key likewise, then proceed to use dnf or yum commands to update
at your leisure.

apt
---

For Debian, one is to add into ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/grommunio.list``:

.. code-block::

	deb [trusted=yes] https://download.grommunio.com/community/Debian_11 Debian_11 main

Then import the GPG key and proceed to use apt commands to update at your
leisure.

.. image:: repodeb-1.png

.. image:: repodeb-2.png

.. image:: repodeb-3.png

For Ubuntu installations, the ``universe`` repository is required in addition
to the base install.


4. nginx
========

nginx is used as a frontend to handle all HTTP requests, and to forward them to
further individual services. For example, RPC/HTTP requests will be delegated
to Gromox for further processing, Administration API (AAPI for short) requests
will be delegated to an uwsgi instance for further processing, and Mattermost
requests to the chat API.

An alternative HTTP server may be used if you feel comfortable in configuring
all of it, however this guide will only focus on nginx. Now then, source the
nginx package from your operating system, and have the service started both on
next boot and immediately.

.. image:: nginx-1.png

.. image:: nginx-2.png

In this screenshot, we also requested the installation of the nginx VTS module,
which AAPI can *optionally* for reporting traffic statistics. VTS is
**not** available for all platforms, in which case you have to omit and make do
without it.

Being the main entrypoint for everything, the nginx HTTPS network service,
generally port 443, will need to be configured in the packet filter to be
accessible (publicly).

We have a support package that contains premade configuration fragments
for nginx. Do install ``grommunio-common`` to have these to the filesystem. The
initial fragment loading still needs to be explicitly done.


5. TLS certificates
===================

Advance list about which entities will prospectively need access to the
certificate(s):

* nginx

* postfix, if TLS is desired

* gromox, operating as the ``gromox`` system account (this account is created as part
  of the installation of the ``gromox`` package)

Self-signed certificate

6. MariaDB
==========

MariaDB/MySQL is used to store the user database amongst a few auxiliary
configuration parameters. If you plan on erecting a multi-host Gromox cluster,
this database is the one that is meant to be globally available to all nodes
that will eventually be running Gromox services.

A preexisting MariaDB server may be used. All the standard tools and
procedures that the world community has developed around SQL are applicable, in
terms of e.g. configuration, backup/restore, and replication.

Assuming though that you are going for a new SQL server instance, source the
MariaDB packages from your operating system, and have the service started
both on next boot and immediately.

.. image:: mysql-1.png

.. image:: mysql-2.png

After the installation, do create a blank database and user identity for
accessing it.

.. image:: mysql-3.png

.. code-block:: sql

	CREATE DATABASE `grommunio`;
	GRANT ALL ON `grommunio`.* TO 'grommunio'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'freddledgruntbuggly';

The MariaDB network service is not meant to be open to the public Internet.
Within your private network, it may need to be opened if (and only if) you plan
on using it in a multi-host Grommunio setup, or when your plans about database
replication demand it.

In certain versions, such as MySQL 8 on Ubuntu 20.04, the GRANT statement no
longer implicitly creates users. At this point, one will need

.. code-block:: sql

	CREATE USER 'grommunio'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'freddledgruntbuggly';
	GRANT ALL ON `grommunio`.* TO 'grommunio'@'localhost';


7. Gromox
=========

Gromox is the central groupware server component of grommunio. It provides
the services for Outlook RPC, IMAP/POP3, an LDA for ingestion, and a PHP
module for Z-MAPI.

The package is available by way of the Grommunio repositories. This guide is
subsequently based on such a pre-built Gromox. Experts wishing to build from
source and who have general knowledge on how to do so are referred to the
`Gromox installation documentation
<https://github.com/grommunio/gromox/doc/install.rst>`_ on specific aspects of
the build procedure.

.. image:: gromox-1.png

The connection parameters for MariaDB need to be conveyed to Gromox with the
file ``/etc/gromox/mysql_adaptor.cfg``, whose contents could look like this::

	mysql_username=grommunio
	mysql_password=freddledgruntbuggly
	mysql_dbname=grommunio
	schema_upgrade=host:mail.route27.test

The data stored in MariaDB is shared among all mailbox nodes in a clustered
setup. Table schema (DDL) changes are necessary at times, but at most one node
in such a cluster should perform these changes to avoid running the risk of
corruption. The hostname after ``host:`` specifies which machine will be
considered authoritative, if any. The ``schema_upgrade=host:...`` line should
be consistent across all mailbox nodes. It is possible to completely omit
``schema_upgrade``, at which point no updates will be done automatically.

With Gromox instrumented on the SQL parameters, proceed now with performing the
initial creation of the database tables by issuing the command:

.. code-block:: sh

	gromox-dbop -C

Manual updates can be performed later with

.. code-block:: sh

	gromox-dbop -U

.. image:: gromox-2.png

Gromox runs a number of processes and network services. None of them are meant
to be open to the public Internet, because nginx is already that important
point of ingress. The Gromox exmdb service (port 5000/tcp by default) needs to
be reachable from other Gromox nodes in a multi-host grommunio setup for
reasons of internal forwarding to a mailbox's home server.

The first services which need no further configuration can be enabled:

.. code-block:: sh

	systemctl enable --now gromox-event gromox-timer

Now edit ``/etc/gromox/http.cfg``, where a few modifications will need to be
made, such as specifying the locations of the TLS certificate files.
Furthermore, because we have set up nginx earlier as a frontend to listen on
ports 80 and 443, gromox-http needs to be moved "out the way" (its built-in
defaults are also 80/443). A manual page is provided with all the configuration
directives and can be called up with ``man 8gx http``.

.. code-block::

	listen_port=10080
	listen_ssl_port=10443
	http_support_ssl=yes
	http_certificate_path=certificate.pem
	http_private_key=certificate.key

With this, ``gromox-http`` can be launched.

.. code-block:: sh

	systemctl enable --now gromox-http


8. PHP-FPM
