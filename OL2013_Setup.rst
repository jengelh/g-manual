Outlook 2010/2013 setup and the quirks
======================================

Preface summary
---------------

At the end of May 2022, this document's German screenshots were slated for
replacement with the English version. In that attempt, more weirdness
protruded.

1. English OL2013 15.0.5125.1000 / MAPI 15.0.5449:

	AutoDiscover handler offering MH:

		AutoDiscover completes, MAPI profile runs on MH,
		no traces of RPCH configuration found. All good.

	ADH offering only RPCH:

		The wizard fails the Autodiscover stage.
		Eventually leads you over to manual setup mode.

	Manual setup:

		The wizard is somehow completely unable to make a successful
		RPCH connection.

2. German OL2013 (exact version tbd):

AutoDiscover succeeds, you can also do manual setup, or switch to manual after
AD has signalled success. Either way you go, the wizard somehow gets the idea
it wants to talk to a magic hostname "SERVERS". You can end the wizard
successfully and it believes it has a connection, but actually does not. The
MAPI profile remains broken and the bogus RPC server name needs to be edited
with MFCMAPI. Once *that* is done, it actually works very well over RPCH.



Control Panel
-------------

Open Control Panel and the E-Mail control widget and create a new profile.
Alternatively, new profiles can be created when launching Outlook if and
when it shows its profile selection dialog (requires that no profile be marked
as default yet).

Special dialog for domain-joined accounts
-----------------------------------------

When creating a new profile in Outlook, you may be presented with a dialog that
has only two fields (name, email address), with the name field being filled in
and grayed out already. This can happen if the computer is joined to an
existing NT/ActiveDirectory domain.

.. image:: profwithdom.png

If you were to leave those fields as-is, the wizard might skip AutoDiscover or
use the AutoDiscover of the domain controller (especially when there is already
an Exchange server). We have observed that, in such a domain, the wizard
proceeds and uses the domain controller's name as the RPC server name, thereby
causing requests to never reach the Gromox server.

Modifying the email address field value switches the dialog to present the
usual *four* fields. This action would appear to drop the implied default to
use the domain controller, which is a good thing.


AutoDiscover
------------

.. image:: profnodom2.png

When using automatic mode (i.e. the radiobox "E-mail Account") from the
4(!)-field dialog, the profile wizard proceeds to invoke AutoDiscover. Provided
the DNS domain name resolves to a Gromox server, AutoDiscover should succeed,
even if joined to an NT domain of the same name.

.. image:: profdisco.png

At this point, you may get a warning if you used a _self-signed_ or otherwise
not verifiable TLS certificate. If indeed your Gromox server uses such a
certificate, that is a good sign that AutoDiscover did indeed reach the Gromox
server.

.. image:: proftls.png

Furthermore, there may be also be a second warning. The AutoDiscovery process
uses a number of techniques, and one of them involves testing for a DNS entry
wherein ``autodiscover.`` is preprended to the e-mail domain you entered. If
that DNS entry indeed exists, but is not part of the TLS certificate, the
wizard complains about a certifiace name mismatch.

.. image:: proftls2.png

With TLS squared away either with a proper certificate or ignoring the issue,
AutoDiscover ought to succeed.

.. image:: profdisco2.png

If you get a failure indication instead that an encrypted connection was not
possible, that is usually an indication of a DNS or network issue, and
attempting an unencrypted AutoDiscover request won't fix that.

Turning the attention back to the successful AutoDiscover dialog form (with the
three green checkmarks), you have the option to switch to manual setup mode
using the "Change account settings" checkbox in the lower left of the dialog.
Doing so will make the wizard switch to the next dialog state, titled "Server
settings".

.. image:: profdisco3.png

Since this is a technical documentation exploring the quirks of Outlook, we
recommend you do this for understanding the following descriptions. Continue
reading below at section "RPC hostname troubles".


Manual Setup
------------

If you choose the radiobox "Manual Setup", AutoDiscover will be skipped.

.. image:: profmanual1.png

.. image:: profmanual2.png

After choosing the Exchange server type radio box, you will proceed to the
"Server Settings" view. You should input the server and user name. The OL2013
profile wizard defaults to using RPC over port 135, which is not supported by
Gromox, and so using "Check Name" will not function just yet.

.. image:: profserv2.png

Instead, go to "More Settings" and its Security notebook page, and select
"Anonymous Authentication" from the dropdown.

.. image:: profproxy1.png

Next, goto More Setting's "Connection" notebook page, enable "Connect using
HTTP", and call up the "Proxy Settings" subdialog.

.. image:: profproxy2.png

.. image:: profproxy3.png

Enter the server name *again* in the HTTP field, and switch from "NTLM
Authentication" to "Basic Authentication".

You should enable both "On fast networks, connect using HTTP first" and "On
slow networks, connect using HTTP first".

"Connect using HTTP first, then use TCP/IP" is a misnomer; what it really means
"Connecting using RPCHTTP or MAPIHTTP first, then try RPC-over-TCP".

.. image: profproxy4.png

You can close the More Settings subdialog(s).

If you now use the "Check Name" feature, the server and user name field values
should “resolve”, i.e. become underlined. The server name will also change to
an uncanny value of ``SERVERS``.


RPC hostname troubles
---------------------

If AutoDiscover found the MH/RPCH transport just fine, the "Server Settings"
dialog will show `someguid@domain` in the Server field and the email address in
the username field. In addition, under "More Settings", there will only be
*three* tabs and no way to call up the RPC proxy settings.

.. image:: profdisco5.png

.. image:: profdisco6.png

Now for the odd case with at least one OL2013 variant (German):

Whether you have done Manual Setup or reached this point through AutoDiscover,
you will notice that the RPC server has been changed to the value ``SERVERS``.
We have no indication where this name comes from — searching prominent Windows
DLLs, including, but not limited to, ``rpcrt4.dll``, turns up no string of the
sort, and it is incredibly hard to do an Internet search for the word because a
common word was reused.

.. image:: profrpcbroken.png

The server and email address are underlined and the "Check Names" button is
grayed out, which normally indicates that the two field values have
(supposedly) been succesfully resolved.

You may finish the profile wizard at this point. Read on for more technical
gore though…

Some Windows installations are fine with ``SERVERS``. Some are not. We do not
know exactly why, but one hypothesis is that some versions try to resolve the
RPC server name ahead of the RPCHTTP proxy name. We *did* observe, with
Wireshark, that name lookups were being done for ``SERVERS`` (NBNS, LLMNR
and/or MDNS packets) are being emitted into the network.

By modifying the server or user name field *again* (e.g. remove last character
and add the character back again), the field values go back to unresolved mode
and the "Check Names" button becomes available again. When that check feature
is used again, the server now magically resolves to a new value in the form of
``xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xx-xxxxxxxxxxxx@hostname``. While we know that this is a
endpoint ID for an RPC proxy and we know where it originates from in the source
code, it also does not help to get the mailbox connection going.

.. image:: profrpcat.png

Repeatedly editing a field and using Check Names again, the profile wizard
ping-pongs between ``SERVERS`` and the endpoint ID.

To really fix the wrong RPC server name, using MFCMAPI will become necessary.


MAPI profile data model
-----------------------

.. image:: profmfc1.png

.. image:: profmfc2.png

.. image:: profmfc3.png

Inside the MAPI profile (``a1`` in the screenshots) are (at least) two
services, one of which is for the mailbox, and another is for the addressbook.
The EMSMDB service consists of three or four providers, these should correspond
to the private mailbox, the public mailbox (if any), a transport provider (XP),
and the global address book (GAB). The value ``SERVERS`` can be found in the
properties ``PR_TEST_LINE_SPEED`` (0x662B001F), and 0x662A001F.

.. image:: profmfc4.png

.. image:: profmfc5.png

There is also ``PR_PROFILE_RPC_PROXY_SERVER`` (which contains the
RPCHTTP/MAPIHTTP proxy) and ``PR_PROFILE_UNRESOLVED_SERVER`` (unsure why this
is kept).

The value in the 0x662A001F property correlates with it. Changing this
property in MFCMAPI changes it in the Control Panel dialog.

MFCMAPI shows the property as ``PR_TRANSFER_ENABLED``, but that is not entirely
accurate. Some property IDs are — unfortunately — reused between different
components (e.g. profile vs. mailbox vs. address book), and MFCMAPI just does
not evaluate the context in which it is used, and so prints the wrong name.

The value for ``PR_TEST_LINE_SPEED`` is of no consequence. It is said
to be a special property to make emsmdb.dll always trigger a network request.

Changing ``SERVERS`` to the real host name makes mailbox access possible.

(Later versions of the connector such as from OL2021 do not create
the 0x662A001F property at all anymore.)

---------------

The Windows registry normally needs no changes, but for the curious, there are
some options.
